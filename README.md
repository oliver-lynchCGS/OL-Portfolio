# Oliver's ML Portfolio

Oliver's machine learning portfolio is compromised of three programs (Grade Predictor, K-NN Diabeties Predictor, and KMeans) that dive deep into supervised and unsupervised learning concepts through the algorithms of linear regression, clustering, and k-nearest neighbor in each respective program.

The grade predictor program is an example of linear regression and supervised learning being used in machine learning to predict grades from students.

The K-NN diabeties predictor program is an example of K - nearest neighbor and supervised learning being used in machine learning to predict if someone has diabetes or not.

The KMeans program is an example of a clustering model using unsupervised learning to train the program to group the data and represent it through graphs and a classification report.
