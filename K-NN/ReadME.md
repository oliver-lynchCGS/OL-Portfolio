## K - Nearest Neighbor Model

K-NN, OL Portfolio, this program is an example of K - nearest neighbor and supervised learning being used in machine learning to predict if someone has diabetes or not.  In the data diabetes.csv, there is a variety of health related data for each patient.  To predict if someone has diabetes we take only their Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, BMI, and Insulin data.  Then using the K - nearest neighbor model this data gets grouped into people who have or don't have diabetes.  You can see the outcome of the data at the bottom of the program and its percent accuracy under the last block of code.
