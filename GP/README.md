### A Linear Regression Model

Grade Predictor - OL Portfolio, this program is an example of linear regression and supervised learning being used in machine learning to predict grades from students.  In the data student-mat.csv there is a vast variety of data for each student.  G1, G2, and G3 is grade data for each student.  We use this data to predict a line for best fit for their final grade.  To interpret the data, look at the scatter plot formed by the code after you have run it to see how their final grade is affected by one grade (G1, G2, G3).

# Features:  

predict = "G2", 
Can be changed to any group of grade data in student-mat.csv

p = "G2"
pyplot.scatter(data[p], data["G2"]),
"G2" can be changed to any group of grade data (G1, G2, G3) in student-mat.csv to represent the data on a scatter plot
